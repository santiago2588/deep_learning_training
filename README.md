## Setting Up Your Development Environment 🛠️

### Recommended IDE: Visual Studio Code

We recommend using Visual Studio Code (VS Code) for this workshop as it provides excellent Python and Jupyter Notebook support.

#### Installing VS Code
1. Download VS Code from the [official website](https://code.visualstudio.com/).
2. Follow the installation instructions for your operating system.
3. Install the following extensions for a better experience:
   - Python
   - Jupyter
   - Pylance
   - Python Indent
   - IntelliCode

To install extensions in VS Code, click on the Extensions icon in the sidebar (or press `Ctrl+Shift+X`), search for each extension, and click "Install".

### Why Use a Virtual Environment? 🔒

Using a virtual environment is essential for Python development because it:

- Isolates project dependencies, preventing conflicts between projects
- Makes your project reproducible across different machines
- Allows easy management of package versions
- Keeps your global Python installation clean

### Setting Up a Virtual Environment 📦

#### Windows

```powershell
# Create a virtual environment
python -m venv dl_workshop_env

# Activate the environment
dl_workshop_env\Scripts\activate

# Deactivate the environment when finished
deactivate
```

#### Linux/macOS

```bash
# Create a virtual environment
python -m venv dl_workshop_env

# Activate the environment
source dl_workshop_env/bin/activate

# Deactivate the environment when finished
deactivate
```

### Required Libraries 📚

Install the necessary packages after activating your virtual environment:

```bash
pip install matplotlib numpy pandas scikit-learn jupyter ipywidgets ipympl ipykernel urllib3 requests tqdm albumentations networkx scipy
```

For GPU support (NVIDIA GPUs only):

```bash
# Install the latest version of PyTorch with CUDA support

pip install torch torchvision torchaudio --extra-index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu118

# Note: Replace 'cu118' with the appropriate CUDA version for your system.
```

No GPU? No problem! PyTorch will automatically fall back to CPU. Install the CPU version of PyTorch using the command below:

```bash
pip install torch torchvision torchaudio
```

### Using the Exercise Checker 📝

Each workshop notebook contains exercises marked with 🎯. The exercise checker helps you verify your solutions and provides hints when needed.

#### Checking Your Solutions
```python
# At the end of each exercise, there will be a check block:
answer = {
    'your_solution': your_tensor,
    'another_part': another_result
}
checker.check_exercise(exercise_number, answer)
```

#### Getting Hints
If you're stuck, you can get hints for any exercise:
```python
# Display hints for exercise 1
checker.display_hints(1)
```

#### Exercise Feedback
The checker provides immediate feedback:
- ✅ Correct solutions are marked with a green checkmark
- ❌ Incorrect solutions show what went wrong
- 💡 Helpful hints appear when needed

### Common Workflows

1. **Starting an Exercise**:
   - Read the exercise description carefully
   - Implement your solution in the provided code cell
   - Run the cell to see if it works

2. **Checking Your Work**:
   - The checker automatically validates your solution
   - Multiple aspects may be checked (values, shapes, types)
   - All parts must be correct to pass

3. **Getting Help**:
   - Use `checker.display_hints()` for guidance
   - Hints are context-aware and specific to each exercise
   - Multiple hints may be available per exercise

4. **Learning from Mistakes**:
   - Pay attention to error messages
   - Check tensor shapes and types when debugging
   - Use print statements to understand intermediate results
