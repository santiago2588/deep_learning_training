## Using the Exercise Checker ✅

Throughout the notebooks, you’ll find 🎯 exercises. Use the built-in checker to validate your answers.

```python
answer = {'your_solution': result}
checker.check_exercise(1, answer)
```

### Requesting Hints 💡

```python
checker.display_hints(1)
```

✔️ Correct = green check
❌ Incorrect = feedback provided
💬 Hints are tailored to the task

---

## Common Workflows

1. Read the exercise and implement the solution.
2. Use the checker to validate your work.
3. Request hints if needed.
4. Learn from any mistakes and try again.

---

## Prerequisites 📾

* Basic Python skills
* Some knowledge of basic machine learning concepts
* Familiarity with linear algebra/calculus (optional)
* No PyTorch experience required!
