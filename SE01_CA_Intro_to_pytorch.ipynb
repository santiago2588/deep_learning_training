    "[PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/) is an open source machine learning and deep learning framework based on the Torch library.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why PyTorch?\n",
    "\n",
    "PyTorch is a popular starting point for deep learning research due to its flexibility and ease of use, compared to other frameworks like TensorFlow. It is often recommended to use TensorFlow for **production-level projects**, but PyTorch is a great choice for **research and experimentation**. More explicitly, PyTorch has the following advantages:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Dynamic computation graph**: PyTorch uses a dynamic computation graph, which means that the graph is generated on-the-fly as operations are created. This is in contrast to TensorFlow, which uses a static computation graph. The dynamic computation graph in PyTorch makes it easier to debug and understand the code.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Pythonic**: PyTorch is designed to be Pythonic, which means that it is easy to read and write. This is in contrast to TensorFlow, which uses a more verbose syntax.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Imperative programming**: PyTorch uses imperative programming, which means that you can write code that looks like regular Python code. This is in contrast to TensorFlow, which uses declarative programming.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Setting up the working environment\n",
    "\n",
    "We are going to use different python modules throughout this course. It is not necessary to be familiar with all of them at the moment. Some of these libraries enable us to work with data and perform numerical operations, while others are used for visualization purposes."

We can do this by using the `to` method of a tensor and passing the device as an argument. The device can be either `cuda` or `cpu`. The `cuda` device refers to the GPU, while the `cpu` device refers to the CPU.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Note**: Not all operations are supported on the GPU. If an operation is not supported on the GPU, PyTorch will automatically move the tensor to the CPU and perform the operation there. This can lead to performance issues, so it is important to be aware of which operations are supported on the GPU.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Checking for GPU availability\n",
    "We can check if a GPU is available by using the `torch.cuda.is_available()` method. This method returns a boolean value that indicates whether a GPU is available or not. If a GPU is available, we can use it to accelerate computations.\n",
    "\n",
    "## When to use the GPU\n",
    "Using the GPU is beneficial when we are working with large tensors or when we are performing operations that are computationally expensive. For example, training a deep learning model on a large dataset can be accelerated by using the GPU. However, if we are working with small tensors or performing simple operations, using the CPU may be faster. \n",

    "Typically, we use the GPU for computer vision and natural language processing tasks, where the data is large and the operations are computationally expensive.\n",

    "> **Note**: When choosing between the CPU and GPU, it is important to make sure that all tensors and models are on the same device. If a tensor is on the CPU and a model is on the GPU, PyTorch will automatically move the tensor to the GPU, which can lead to performance issues. It is important to be aware of which device each tensor and model is on.\n"
