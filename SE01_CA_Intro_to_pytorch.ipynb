    "[PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/) is an open source machine learning and deep learning framework based on the Torch library.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why PyTorch?\n",
    "\n",
    "PyTorch is a popular starting point for deep learning research due to its flexibility and ease of use, compared to other frameworks like TensorFlow. It is often recommended to use TensorFlow for **production-level projects**, but PyTorch is a great choice for **research and experimentation**. More explicitly, PyTorch has the following advantages:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Dynamic computation graph**: PyTorch uses a dynamic computation graph, which means that the graph is generated on-the-fly as operations are created. This is in contrast to TensorFlow, which uses a static computation graph. The dynamic computation graph in PyTorch makes it easier to debug and understand the code.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Pythonic**: PyTorch is designed to be Pythonic, which means that it is easy to read and write. This is in contrast to TensorFlow, which uses a more verbose syntax.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Imperative programming**: PyTorch uses imperative programming, which means that you can write code that looks like regular Python code. This is in contrast to TensorFlow, which uses declarative programming.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Setting up the working environment\n",
    "\n",
    "We are going to use different python modules throughout this course. It is not necessary to be familiar with all of them at the moment. Some of these libraries enable us to work with data and perform numerical operations, while others are used for visualization purposes."
