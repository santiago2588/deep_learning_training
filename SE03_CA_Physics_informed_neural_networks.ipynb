    "> <img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CLDiego/uom_fse_dl_workshop/main/figs/icons/reminder.svg\" width=\"20\"/> **Note**: When passing the data to the model, we need to ensure the tensors have `requires_grad=True`. This is important for the autograd engine to track operations on these tensors and compute gradients correctly. This is especially crucial when using optimisers like L-BFGS, which rely on gradient information to update model parameters."
